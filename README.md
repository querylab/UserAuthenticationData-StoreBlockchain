# UserAuthenticationData-StoreBlockchain üë•üîê

This prototype project uses a combination of technologies, such as Solidity, Truffle and ReactJS, to provide a decentralized and secure user authentication solution. Solidity is used to develop smart contracts on the blockchain, while Truffle simplifies their development and implementation. ReactJS is responsible for building an intuitive user interface, and Metamask acts as a browser extension to facilitate interaction with the blockchain and cryptographic signing of login data. Authentication is achieved by connecting to the blockchain and verifying the user's identity before storing the login data securely in the smart contract. In summary, this project offers a secure and decentralized solution thanks to the combination of these technologies.
